# RealTimeBusTracker_MIT

TITLE: Real Time Bus Tracker

DESCRIPTION: 
This code started as an MIT assignment that used mapbox-gl and a set of hard coded coordinates to move a marker along a bus route on a map.
I stylized the map and connected the code to MIT's data files to pull real-time data and create a marker for where the busses are in real-time every few seconds. I also added a few points of interest - resturants between the campuses.

TO RUN:
Download the code and press "show busses." A public key was used to pull data, which should be sufficient so long as you don't press "show busses' a billion times.

ROAD MAP:
-Upload two bus icons, one left facing and one right facing, and use the correct icon depending on which way the bus is traveling. 
-Add points of interest automatically from google if they have more than 4 start ratings and are open while the map is in use.
